# FridgeEase

FridgeEase was a frontend project that I had to do as a school project.
This project is built in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) with [SASS](https://github.com/sass/sass) for the css part. On the backend part I have used an external API that belongs to the food giant ICA ([ICA API](https://github.com/svendahlstrand/ica-api)) to retrieve recipes and [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) for the backend (repo [NodeJs-Backend](https://github.com/Nabizadehse/NodeJs-Backend)) and [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) as a database.

# Get started
